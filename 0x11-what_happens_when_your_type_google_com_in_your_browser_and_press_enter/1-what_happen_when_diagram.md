# Request Flow for Accessing https://www.google.com

## DNS Resolution:

The user's browser initiates a DNS request to resolve "www.google.com" to an IP address.

## Request Hitting Server IP on the Appropriate Port:

The browser sends the request to one of Google's servers, typically on port 443 for HTTPS.

## Traffic Encryption:

The traffic between the browser and the server is encrypted using HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS).

## Traffic Through a Firewall:

The request passes through a firewall, which acts as a security barrier between the internet and the server.

## Request Distributed via Load Balancer:

The request is distributed through a load balancer to ensure even distribution among multiple server instances.

## Web Server Answers Request:

One of the web servers receives the request and responds with the initial webpage content.

## Application Server Generates Web Page:

The application server processes the request, generates dynamic content (if any), and sends it back to the web server.

## Application Server Requests Data from Database:

The application server retrieves necessary data from a database server to generate the webpage content.
