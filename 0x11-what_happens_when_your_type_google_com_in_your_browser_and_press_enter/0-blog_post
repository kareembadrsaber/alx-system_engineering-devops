# Accessing Websites: The Behind-the-Scenes Process

When you type a website address into your web browser and hit enter, there's a complex series of actions that take place behind the scenes. Let's break it down:

## DNS Resolution:

- The browser sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server to translate the human-readable domain name (e.g., "google.com") into an IP address, which computers understand.
- The DNS server responds with the IP address associated with the domain name.

## Establishing Connection:

- Using the IP address received from the DNS server, the browser establishes a connection to the server hosting the website.

## Requesting Webpage:

- The browser sends a request to the server, asking for the HTML code that makes up the webpage.

## Receiving and Rendering:

- The server sends the HTML code back to the browser.
- The browser interprets the HTML code and renders it into a visual webpage that you can see and interact with.

## Fetching Additional Resources:

- The browser may also request additional resources needed to fully display the webpage, such as images, JavaScript files, and CSS stylesheets.

## Displaying the Page:

- The server responds with the requested resources, and the browser displays the fully-loaded webpage.

This entire process happens almost instantaneously, allowing users to seamlessly access information and interact with websites.
